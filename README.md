# RF Explorer Spectrum Analyzers

RF Explorer open source software repository. For more details visit http://j3.rf-explorer.com/40-rfe/article/57-hackers-corner

### Background

Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/rfexplorer 
Initially located on google servers, we migrated into Github when google decided to stop their services.

### Note regarding this fork (https://github.com/VincentGijsen/rfexplorer)

Ive made some very modest changes to make this great software work with an arduino and CC2500. If you feel this software is for you, please considder buying a true RFExplorer device, this mearly some attempt to mimic the bare basics, without any calibration, or proper verification of the sampled signals!

see: https://github.com/VincentGijsen/RFExplorerArduino

don't expect acurate results, when using this modified version, with the arduino code, somewhere within my github account,  BUY THE REAL STUFF
